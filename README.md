# Modeling-a-2-DOF-robot-arm

A course project modeling a two-linked robot arm in MATLAB, finding Lagrangian models motion equation, describing a nonlinear MIMO system, defining its state space equations, linearizing it about its equilibrium point using the Jacobian matrix, and then measuring its different parameters such as stability, controllability, visibility, etc and then designing state feedback and observer and improving its critical parameters using various methods such as adding poles or moving them.
